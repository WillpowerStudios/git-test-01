Testin' Git with Github: 

In Terminal

02. touch readme.md > add read me file 

03. ls > list of files in folder 

04. ls -a > to see all dot files 

05. git init > initialize empty git repository

06. to remove a .git > rm -r .git 

07. git status > to know what's going on 

08. git add -A > to add all files for a commit 

09. git status > to see that all files have been added 

10. in Github, create new repository

11. git commit -m "Initial Commit" > first commit

13. git push -u origin master > Push 

14. github username

15. github password (the terminal purposely does not show you the letters you type nor indicates that you're typing. Type anyways, without error)

16. Check Github > you will see your initial commit !! 

--

01. To Do New Commits !!! > git status 

02. We see 'modified:' + 'names of files' in red > git add readme.md ('readme.md' is the file I want to push)

03. git add . > to add file  

04. it says 'modified:' + 'name of file' in green > shows that we successfully added the file(s)

05. git commit -m "process of using git with oF" > '-m' is message (useful for noting what changes were made)

06. git push (ALMIGHTY PUSH !) 

07. Check github, it's been pushed !! Jaaaa !!!!
